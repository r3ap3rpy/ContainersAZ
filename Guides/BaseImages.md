### Base images

Coming from public or private repositories. Use **docker pull** to check it.

**docker images** gives you a list of available images.

**docker search <name>** allows you to search for specific images.

For example **docker pull httpd** which pulls the latest version of the apache project image.

You can get a detailed information about images with **docker inspect httpd**.
